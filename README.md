# Matplotlib Visualizations

This project involves cleaning and combining multiple datasets in order to create visualizations and run statistical analyses to determine the effectiveness of different drug regimens on the treatment of skin cancer in mice.

## Tools

The following tools and libraries were used in this analysis:

   * Pandas: for data manipulation and cleaning
   * Matplotlib: for data visualization
   * Scipy.stats: for statistical analysis
   * Numpy: for numerical computing

## Data Cleaning

The cleaning of this data involved:

   * Combining the two CSV files into a single DataFrame
   * Finding and dropping any duplicate values in the dataset

## Summary Statistics

Once the data was cleaned, summary statistics were run in order to analyze the tumor volumes for each drug regimen.

## Visualizations

Several different visualizations are created in order to learn more about the results, including:

   * the sample size for each treatment regimen

   * gender distribution

   * final tumor volume after treatment for the top 4 most effective drug regimens

   * the relationship between tumor volume and mouse weight.
